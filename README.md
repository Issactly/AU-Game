### Plot (Draft)
You are trying to prove the multiverse exists and while doing so accidentally create rifts that pull people from their world into yours. The bad guys included. Now its up to you to find everyone and send them home. Build your team and balance stats to fight boses, collecting artifacts that unlock new characters and gear. Try endless mode to gain xp and test your strenght or hit the caves to harvest materials to better your weapons. You can also take a break and enjoy farming, fishing and home decor.

### Char Build Aspects ◢


TYPE | DESCRIPTION 
------- | -------
Melee | Close range, Usually a cone-shaped area in front of the character where enemies within take dmg.
Ranged | Long range, Usually a cone-shaped area in front of the character that works as view and enm within can be hit. Enm out of view cone can still be hit as long as they are along the line the char is/was _facing_ when shooting/casting _and_ not too far out of launch range.
Support | No specific attack style, low atk, skills are focused on aiding other teammates.

ATK TYPES | DESCRIPTION 
------- | -------
Physical | Anything that physically touches counts as physical atk dmg. (Ex: magic users with summoned or casted weapons, frost users using ice to stab or punch, etc)
Magic (unspecified) | Things like spells or generally uncategorized things like psychic moves. Magic can be a mix of different elements as well so it's very versatile
Dark | Uses things like shadows, 'dark' maps give buffs to chars with this atk type
Light | Uses light and reflections, 'bright' maps and 'wet' maps give buffs to most chars with this atk type
Energy | Not the same as stamina or electric, mainly used by futuristic and magic atk type chars though
Fire | Heat, lava, fire. Mainly used by hellish atk type chars
Frost | Ice, snow, frost and some weather. A rare atk type
Water | Uses water to deal dmg (best against magma enm)
Electricity | Shocking atks, can power machines, and heal futuristics
